# FGM_2018

This repository contains code from my final project in Foundations of Graphical Models, a course I took fall 2018 at Columbia. 

My goal was to implement Black Box Variational Inference for Baeysian logistic regression, and apply it to a datset of rare variants. 

This code was a re-implementation of [Keyon Vafa's code, written in python](https://github.com/keyonvafa/logistic-reg-bbvi-blog/blob/master/log_reg_bbvi.py)
